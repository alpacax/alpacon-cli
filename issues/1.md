### Issue: Release Workflow Failure Due to Invalid go.mod File

#### Description
The release workflow has failed due to issues in the `go.mod` file. The failure was caused by:
1. Specifying the Go version as `go 1.23.0` instead of the correct format `go 1.23`.
2. Including an unrecognized `toolchain go1.23.6` directive.

#### Action Items
Please update the `go.mod` file to:
- Use the correct Go version format: `go 1.23`.
- Remove the unrecognized `toolchain go1.23.6` directive.
